# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Method that takes in 2 HashMaps and join them into one data structure.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, 
they are appended to the result row. If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.
