# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Method called MergeList that takes in a two linked lists and Zip through bothe of the list and merges them by switch between 
ever other list.
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes 
alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). 
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approcah we took was have 2 runners and a scout and setting the referances to to those runners equal to the scout or the next node on the other list
