# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
The challenge is to create a Breath first approach that takes in as input a Binary Tree and output the value of the node as it gets seen 
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in 
methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach;
print every visited nodeâ€™s value.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time - O(n) Space - O(W) W = width
