<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implementation of a Hash Table in C# 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Hash table with the following methods
1. Add method that takes in a key and a value it should hash the key then add the key and value to the table.
2. Get Method  that takes in a key and returns the value asocciated to that key.
3. Contains Method that takes in a key and returns a bool if the key was found in the hash table it should return true otherwise false.
4. Hash method that takes in a key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Hash Tables have an Best case O(1) lookup and Worst being O(n).

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
1. Add(string key, string value)
2. Get(string key)
3. Contain(string key)
4. GetHash(string key
