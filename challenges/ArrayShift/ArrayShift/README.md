# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
The Challenge is to write a function that takes in an array and value. And takes that value adds it to the middile index of that array

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing
any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We are creating a new array that we return with the value being placed in the  middile. We start with a for loop that will go throw the array that is one size bigger than the array given and inside that for loop we placed if statements that check for the middile.
