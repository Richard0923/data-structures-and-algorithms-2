# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a method that takes in a tree and if the nodes in that tree are divisable by 15, 5 or 3 set the value to FuzzBuzz

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
If the value of the node is divisable by 15 set the value to FuzzBuzz
If the value of the node is divisable by 5 set the value to Buzz
If the value of the node is divisable by 3 set the value to Fuzz
Then we would return the Tree with its new values 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Our Big O is Space = O(1) Time = O(log n)
