# Lecture Notes: Quick Sort Algorithm

QuickSort is a Another Divide and conquer algorithm that picks an element in the array as pivot and splits the array in half. The key part of this algorithm is its partition 
that does all the work spliting the array and comparing/placing them according to the value of that pivot. Its worth mentioning that quick sort hence the name is one of the most fastest 
sorting algorithm.
