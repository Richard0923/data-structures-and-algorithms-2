# DSA Practice

## Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
1. Calculate the Height of a binary tree.
2. Check of a binary tree is balanced.
3. Check of two values in a binary tree share an ancestory relationship.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. CalculateBinaryTreeHieght(Node node) 
returns a integer.

2. IsBalanced(Node node)
returns a bool

3. IsAncestor(int value1, int value2, Node node)
returns a bool

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. Time = O(H) H = hieght of the callstack.
   Space = O(1) 

2. Time = O(H) H = hieght of the callstack.
   Space = O(1)
   
3. TBD
