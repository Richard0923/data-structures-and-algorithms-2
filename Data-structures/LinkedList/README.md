# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a 3 methods that iterates through a Linked list and adds a new node 

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Creating 3 methods:
1. .Append- That adds and node to the linked list
2. .insertBefore(value, newVal) adds a new node before the current node that equal the value given.
3. .insertAfter(value, newVal) adds a new node after the current node that equals dthe value given

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a method that takes in an integer k then goes though an linked list and returns the value that of the position that is equal to k from the end of the linked list.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Creating 3 methods:
1. Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number k
2. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The apporach we took was having a while loop and setting the current to the last node of the linked list and having a second current that k distance  away from that node
